We launch our products on Kickstarter, where we’ve raised over $30M across 9 projects. We’re entirely crowdfunded—no outside investors—and that gives us the freedom to focus on the things that matter most to us: designing the best products, fostering happy employees, and taking care of our customers and natural environment. There are currently 36 of us. We love our jobs, we love each other, and we couldn’t be more stoked for the future of our company.\n\nWe also believe a diverse team is an innovative team and something worth celebrating. A range of perspectives and backgrounds creates a stronger and more creative work environment (not to mention more fun). We’re committed to equality and inclusivity across race, gender, age, religion, identity, and experience.\n\nWe are adding a digital designer to our team, and we hope it’s you! We need the eye of a... graphic designer, the chops/skills of a web designer, and the intuition of a UX designer. You would be joining our close-knit graphics/branding team to keep the look and feel of Peak Design one of the sharpest in the world of outdoor gear and product design.\n\nYOUR DELIVERABLES\n• Chief among your responsibilities would be spearheading projects related to our website. Peakdesign.com is the beating heart of our business, and it is always being tweaked in ways big and small.\n• There are plenty of other projects that need TLC, as well: packaging design, in-store experience design, advertising campaigns, digital and print assets for various channels, general brand strategy.\n• Identifying problems and places for improvement and then working with other teams (at Peak and externally) to bring those projects to life.\nYOUR SKILLS\n• You are passionate about web design. You fiddle with html and css, you're familiar with Figma, you can use Adobe Creative suite in your sleep, you're great at concepting, wireframing, and interfacing with engineers/developers. (gasp!)\n• You are a great communicator, written and verbally. You can design but you can also talk about design.\n• You are disciplined, organized, inquisitive and driven. We operate with as little structure as possible and our team is increasingly dispersed, you are a self starter that can turn a vague idea into a tangible asset with limited input.\n• Obsession with detail but commitment to larger, strategic vision.\n• Ability to quickly turn feedback into design changes.\nPERKS!\n• Work from Home!\n• Flexible work schedule\n• Comprehensive medical, mental, dental, and vision benefits for you and your family\n• 401(k) retirement plan that allows pre-tax, Roth, and after-tax contributions with an employer match.\n• Employee Purchase Program\n• FSA, HSA, Commuter Benefits\n• Career development reimbursement (classes, conferences, workshops of your choosing)\n• Unlimited paid vacation\n• HRA Fertility Benefits including egg freezing\n• 100% paid parental leave\n• Annual 2-3 day company retreat\n• and more",
