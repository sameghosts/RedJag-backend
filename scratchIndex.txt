# Steps to do for MVP goals of Job journal and User tomorrow:

  Define User queries 
    Base queries XXXX
  Define User mutations
    Base Registration mutation def XXXX
  write user resolvers

JobJournal stuff
Define JobJournal TypeDefs
define JJ queries
Define JJ mutations
define JJ resolvers

Server General
  AuthMiddleware
  Helperfunctions
  dotenv set up mongo Atlas and connect
  Do initial user creation and auth login testing
  Add auth middlware to user querys and mutations




Mongo commands: 

db
   = this will show you which db you are connected to

use [name of database]
  = use is a keyword that will create a new database of that name or 

db.collectionName.insert({
  key: "value",
  otherKey: "value value",
  key1: "foo",
  foo: "bar"
})

"db.[collectionName].insert({})" = using this command you can write to your database. in the quoted example here you would use the hard brackets, just replace the whole thing including the brackets with the desired database collection name and it will work. Inside the curly brackets, as seen in the example above you can add any number of key value pairs separated by commas.
